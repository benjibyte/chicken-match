# chicken-match game

This game is a simple Matching Tiles game for some very young members of my family. Also a cute pixel art project my Mother thought of, and when I showed her a Game Jam video, she didn't believe me that a game could be made in just 96 hours. So that's why this exists. I wanted to prove to myself that...even making something so simple... It was possible.
